# Amazon Clone Design

## Overview

This is a static front-end design of the Amazon website, created using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The focus is on replicating the visual layout and styling of key Amazon website sections, such as the homepage, navigation bar, and product listings. This design does not include JavaScript or back-end functionality, serving as a practice to enhance HTML and CSS skills.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: A styled header with a logo, search bar, and account options, designed to mimic Amazon's layout.
- **Hero Section**: A visually appealing banner section for featured promotions or products.
- **Product Grid**: A responsive grid layout for product cards, including images, titles, prices, and ratings.
- **Footer**: A multi-column footer with links, styled to resemble Amazon's footer.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens using CSS media queries.
- **CSS Effects**: Hover effects and transitions on buttons and product cards for enhanced visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic and structured content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layouts (Flexbox, Grid), animations, and responsive design.
