# Amazon Clone

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon website, built using **HTML** and **CSS** to replicate the core design and layout. The focus is on creating a visually appealing and responsive interface that mimics key sections of Amazon's website, such as the homepage, product listings, and navigation bar. No JavaScript or back-end functionality is included, as the goal is to enhance HTML and CSS skills.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: A sticky header with a logo, search bar, and user account options.
- **Hero Section**: A prominent banner or carousel-like section for featured products or promotions.
- **Product Listings**: Grid-based layout for displaying product cards with images, titles, prices, and ratings.
- **Footer**: A multi-column footer with links to various sections, mimicking Amazon's footer design.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using CSS media queries.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on buttons, product cards, and links for enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic and structured content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layouts (Flexbox, Grid), animations, and responsiveness.
